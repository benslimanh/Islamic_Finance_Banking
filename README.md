## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves the development of a comprehensive **Financial Dashboard** to analyze and compare the performance of three leading Islamic banks in the GCC region:
1. **Al Rajhi Bank** (Saudi Arabia)
2. **Kuwait Finance House - KFH** (Kuwait)
3. **Dubai Islamic Bank - DIB** (UAE)

The dashboard provides a visual "Health Check" of these institutions over a 3-year period (2022-2024), focusing on profitability, liquidity, and risk management.

## 💡 Key Business Insights
The analysis focuses on three critical financial KPIs:

### 1. Profitability Analysis (Net Profit)
* **Goal:** Track year-over-year growth in net income.
* **Finding:** **Al Rajhi Bank** dominates the sector with the highest absolute profits, while **KFH** demonstrates the fastest *growth rate* (+110% over 2 years), indicating aggressive market expansion.

### 2. Liquidity & Asset Base (Deposits)
* **Goal:** Measure consumer confidence and funding stability.
* **Finding:** There is a direct correlation between deposit growth and profit growth across all three banks, with Al Rajhi maintaining the largest deposit base ($170B+).

### 3. Risk Management (NPL Ratio)
* **Goal:** Assess the quality of the loan book (Non-Performing Loans).
* **Finding:** **Al Rajhi** maintains the lowest risk profile (0.4% NPL), suggesting a conservative lending strategy (Murabaha). **DIB** has a higher risk ratio (1.8%) but shows a positive trend of improvement year-over-year.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `Pandas` (Data Manipulation), `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (Advanced Visualization).
* **Technique:** Programmatic Dashboarding (automating financial reporting without external BI tools).
